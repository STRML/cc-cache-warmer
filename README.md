# cc-cache-warmer

A Claude Code plugin that keeps an idle session's prompt cache warm for a few
cache lifetimes, then runs `/compact` on it.

When you leave a session idle past its cache TTL (1 hour on a Claude
subscription, 5 minutes on an API key), your next message rewrites the whole
context into the cache. On a long session that rewrite is the most expensive
turn you send. This plugin sends a short keep-alive prompt just before the
cache expires, so the next turn reads the cache instead of rewriting it. After
a few pings it compacts the session and stops, so a session you never come
back to leaves a small summary to rewrite instead of the full context.

> **Requires [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux).** A hook can't submit
> a prompt to Claude Code, so the plugin types into the session's own cmux pane.
> tmux, iTerm2, and other terminals aren't supported yet. PRs welcome.

## How it works

```
you stop typing
      │
Stop hook ──▶ timer: wait 2 s, read the cache TTL from the transcript
      │
      ▼  sleep TTL - 5 min (55 min for 1h, 4 min for 5m)
guards: session idle? input box empty? screen readable?
      │
      ├─ pings < N ─▶ type the keep-alive prompt ─▶ reply ends a turn ─▶ Stop again
      ├─ pings = N ─▶ type /compact
      └─ pings > N ─▶ nothing, until you send a message
```

Any message you type cancels the pending timer and resets the count. The
plugin compares each prompt with the text it last sent, so its own pings
don't reset the count.

Measured on a 70k-token session: the keep-alive turn read 70,471 tokens from
the cache, wrote 133, and produced 4 output tokens.

## What it saves

A keep-alive costs one cache read. The turn it saves costs a full 1h cache
write. Prices below are Anthropic's API rates for a 180k-token context (close
to the 181,533 tokens a live ping read in the session that tested this).

| | Claude Opus 5.5 | Claude Sonnet 5 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Base input | $4.00/MTok | $2.00/MTok |
| 1h cache write (2x) | $8.00/MTok | $4.00/MTok |
| Cache read | $0.20/MTok (0.05x) | $0.20/MTok (0.1x) |
| **Cold resume** (rewrite 180k) | **$1.44** | **$0.72** |
| One keep-alive (read 180k, plus a short reply) | ~$0.04 | ~$0.04 |
| Warm resume (read 180k) | $0.036 | $0.036 |

What that means per idle gap on Opus 5.5:

```
you come back after...     without plugin   with plugin (3 pings, then compact)
under 1 h                  $0.04            $0.04    cache still warm, no ping sent
1 h to ~3 h 40 min         $1.44            ≤ $0.17  1-3 pings + warm resume
never                      $0               ~$0.12   3 pings, plus one /compact turn
after the compact          $1.44            summary-sized cold write
```

On Opus 5.5 a full warm-and-come-back cycle costs about a tenth of one cold
resume, so the plugin pays for itself if you return to at least 1 idle session
in 12 inside the warm window. On Sonnet 5 a read is a larger share of a write:
the cycle costs about a fifth of a cold resume, and the bar is 1 in 6. On a subscription you pay in usage limits rather
than dollars. The dollar figures show the ratios at API prices.

## Prior art: oh-my-pi

[oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (omp) has both halves of this
built into the agent loop, which is where the idea came from. Claude Code
exposes no hook that can send a request, so this plugin drives the terminal
instead.

| | oh-my-pi | cc-cache-warmer |
|---|---|---|
| **Cache warming** | Since 18.3.5. Shortly before a cache entry expires, the agent replays its last request and cuts it off at the first generated token. | Types a keep-alive prompt, which becomes a real turn. |
| Transcript growth | None | One short user and assistant turn per ping |
| When it warms | Only when the expected avoided-miss cost beats the refresh cost by $0.05. Stops as soon as a refresh misses. | Up to `CC_CACHE_WARMER_PINGS` times on contexts over `CC_CACHE_WARMER_MIN_TOKENS` |
| TTLs covered | `providers.cacheWarming: idle` (the default) covers 5-minute entries only | 1h and 5m, read from the transcript |
| **Idle compaction** | `compaction.idleEnabled` (default off). Compacts after `idleTimeoutSeconds` (300) idle when context exceeds `idleThresholdTokens` (200k). Does not auto-continue. | Types `/compact` after the last ping |
| How the two combine | Independent settings | One sequence: warm N times, then compact |

## Install

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add STRML/cc-cache-warmer
claude plugin install cc-cache-warmer@cc-cache-warmer
```

Run Claude Code inside a cmux pane. Outside cmux, the plugin logs a skip and
does nothing.

## Settings

Set these as environment variables before you start `claude`.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CC_CACHE_WARMER_PINGS` | `3` | Keep-alive pings before `/compact`. |
| `CC_CACHE_WARMER_MIN_TOKENS` | `50000` | Smaller contexts aren't worth warming. |
| `CC_CACHE_WARMER_DELAY` | TTL - 5 min | Seconds to wait before each ping. For testing. |

## When it does nothing

Each skip is logged to `warmer.log` in the plugin's data directory
(`~/.claude/plugins/data/<plugin-id>/`).

| Log line | Cause |
|---|---|
| `skip: not in cmux` | `CMUX_SURFACE_ID` is unset. |
| `skip: no cache info` | The transcript has no cache write. Non-Anthropic backends often report none. |
| `skip: small context` | The context is below `CC_CACHE_WARMER_MIN_TOKENS`. |
| `skip: session active` | A message or reply landed after the timer armed. Idle recaps and metadata records do not count. |
| `skip: draft in input` | You left text in the input box. The plugin won't type over it. |
| `skip: cannot read screen` | `cmux read-screen` failed, or no input box is visible (for example, a permission prompt is open). |
| `skip: done` | The session is compacted. The next message you send restarts the cycle. |

## Tests

```sh
./tests/e2e.sh
```

Each scenario matches one row of the failure matrix in
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). A fake `cmux` on `PATH` records every call. The
results land in `tests/out/results.txt`. CI runs shellcheck and the suite on
Linux and macOS on pushes to main and on every pull request.
